These dotfiles are for the `Rome` and `Antium` rice configurations. Some scripts are used by them (including full aesthetic switch-outs by invoking the rice script) so you may want to [check those out] (https://github.com/VivaCaligula/SCRIPTS) as well. 

Lots of functionality has been added to `Rome`; the tray shows docked programs in the top left (keybase in the pic), weather and mail scripts added, when clicked the stripes expand into power menus, when clicked the middle calender date changes to a clock, and dmenu (which appears under polybar now) matches the system colors generated by pywal.
